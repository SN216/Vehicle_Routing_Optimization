## Introduction

The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a classic logistics problem where the goal is to determine the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to a set of locations. This project uses Genetic Algorithms (GA) to find efficient solutions and compares the results with the Nearest Neighbor (NN) heuristic method.

## Features

- **Genetic Algorithm**: Implements a GA to find optimal routes for multiple vehicles.
- **Nearest Neighbor Heuristic**: Provides a baseline heuristic method for comparison.
- **Multi-objective Optimization**: Minimizes both the total distance traveled and the variance in distances among vehicles.
- **Visualization**: Uses Matplotlib to visualize routing solutions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python)
